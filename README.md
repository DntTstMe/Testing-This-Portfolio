# Testing-This-Portfolio
This portfolio will display present and/or future applications as well as contact information, my work, name and an up-to-date photo.

## Description

* My motivation for this project was to exercise my recently learned HTML and CSS skills to create my first ever Portfolio page to showcase present and future projects as I grow throughout my career.
* I created this project so I could have an easily accessible location to showcase my projects for future employers and to also show my growth as a web developer.
* This project solves the problem of originally having no location to put all of my future projects to show future employers and/or peers.
* I learned that dedicating your time and putting in the work is both rewarding and enlightening. I learned a lot and feel more confiedent in myself than I did previously.*
* I feel that my project stands out because it is a piece of me that I put lots of hardwork and time into adjusting and styling so that I could feel proud of how far I have already come in the program.
